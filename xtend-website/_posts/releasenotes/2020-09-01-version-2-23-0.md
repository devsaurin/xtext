Xtend 2.23.0 is a maintenance release.

## Call to Action: Secure the future maintenance of Xtext & Xtend

As you might have recognized, the number of people contributing to Xtext & Xtend on a regular basis has declined over the past years and so has the number of contributions. At the same time the amount of work for basic maintenance has stayed the same or even increased with the new release cadence of Java and the Eclipse simultaneous release. Briefly: The future maintenance of Xtext & especially Xtend is at risk. If you care, please join the discussion in [https://github.com/eclipse/xtext/issues/1721](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext/issues/1721).

## Xtext, Xtend and Java 11

As you might have noticed, Eclipse Platform and JDT require Java 11 with their new 2020-09 / 4.17 release. Xtext and thus Xtend make use of Platform and JDT in Eclipse and Standalone+LSP mode. So we have to update the minimal required Java version to Java 11 sooner or later. We plan to do this step with the next release (2.24 / 2020-12). Please feel free to participate in [https://github.com/eclipse/xtext/issues/1804](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext/issues/1804) if you have any comments or objections.
